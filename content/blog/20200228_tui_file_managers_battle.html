<p>Comparing `ranger`, `Vifm` and `LF`</p>
</header>
<h1> </h1>

<p>Since two years ago, I&#8217;ve tried some terminal file managers and ended up finding three of my taste.</p>

<p>The first one was <code>ranger</code>. It conquered me for being controled in a vim-like style, having a vim-like config file, having 3 panes (the first showing the parent directory files, the middle one, the files at your directory, and the third, a preview of the selected folder/file), being able to show me pitures directly on the terminal via <code>w3m</code> (although it was not very stable), and also been written in <em>Python</em>, which was my first programming language! Then I perceived it was really a good piece of software, but this last &#8220;advatage&#8221; turned out to be a disgustful characteristic: anything written in <em>Python</em> is inherently slower than it might be. And <code>ranger</code> is really slow, sometimes as slow as a gui file browser.</p>

<p>So I tried <code>Vifm</code> and loved it: it is written in <em>C</em>, that is a language that not only I comprehend, as it is usually refference in velocity marks. And <code>Vifm</code> is <em>de facto</em> way faster than <code>ranger</code>. I could also preview images here, both using w3m or, better, using <code>ueberzug</code>, that is much better (gets me no fickering or instabilities). Another thing I liked about <code>Vifm</code> was that its config files were even closer to <code>vim</code>&#8217;s than <code>ranger</code>&#8217;s were.</p>

<p>Well, the only thing that annoyed me was its panes. You always open to directories at once and looks at them both in panes. It makes te screen a mess by default. You could hide the seccond, but, if you wanted to preview a file with a pager or anything, you would have to reopen it and transform that seccond pane into a preview pane. I didn&#8217;t like it at all.</p>

<p>So some time ago I&#8217;ve discovered <code>LF</code>. <code>LF</code> is basically <code>ranger</code>, but almost as fast as <code>Vifm</code>, as it is well written in <em>Go</em>. It has some advantages, though: you can create functions inside the config file, and you write it in <em>shell script</em>, not in <em>Python</em> (it has never made sense). Also, the overall advage is: it launches a daemon at the first time you launch the program. And what it means? It means you can copy a file at one instance of <code>LF</code>, open another one in another terminal or multiplexer section, and then paste the file there! It is just amazing, something I missed in my previous TUI file managers. The only current disavantage is: image previwing is still not easily solved. I&#8217;m trying to make it work, though!</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ll make them three be evaluated in a table:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Atribute \ File manager</th>
  <th align="center">ranger</th>
  <th align="center">vifm</th>
  <th align="center"><strong>lf</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Velocity</td>
  <td align="center">3</td>
  <td align="center"><strong>10</strong></td>
  <td align="center">9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Ease viewing of files</td>
  <td align="center"><strong>10</strong></td>
  <td align="center">3</td>
  <td align="center"><strong>10</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Integrated multple instances</td>
  <td align="center">0</td>
  <td align="center">0</td>
  <td align="center"><strong>10</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Improvability</td>
  <td align="center">4</td>
  <td align="center">8</td>
  <td align="center"><strong>10</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Vim-like</td>
  <td align="center">8</td>
  <td align="center"><strong>9</strong></td>
  <td align="center"><strong>9</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Image previews</td>
  <td align="center">5</td>
  <td align="center"><strong>8</strong></td>
  <td align="center">0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Rounded Normalized total</strong></td>
  <td align="center">6</td>
  <td align="center">7</td>
  <td align="center"><strong>9</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Then I conclude with my criteria that <code>LF</code> is the most switable TUI file manager for users like me. It is a very extensible tool and I recommend you to check my <em>lfrc</em> &#8212; the LF configuration file &#8212; settings in <a href="https://github.com/marcosrdac/dotfiles/blob/dotfiles_bspwm/.config/lf/lfrc">my dotfiles at GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>For Arch users: both <code>ranger</code> and <code>vifm</code> are in Arch&#8217;s official repositories. You can install <code>LF</code> from AUR.</p>
