<p>
still I try to read you <br>
from a picture <br>
shooted so long ago <br>
</p>

<p>
were you always like him, <br>
the one near the sofa? <br>
and what did I mean? <br>
</p>

<p>
or were you like him <br>
the one by the pestle? <br>
...actually it's a line we're in <br>
</p>

<p>
have I abbandoned you? <br>
killed you with no mercy? <br>
I think I've embraced you <br>
I think I'm mounting the goat <br>
</p>

<p>
you suffer from your <br>
deadly zombie beliefs <br>
viruses plotted in your brain... <br>
both of us may never understand <br>
how could you leave the game? <br>
</p>

<p>
come on, hug me tight <br>
for my hands are cold <br>
and I need your soul <br>
to clean my knife <br>
</p>

<p>
you once said <br>
you're through the bridge <br>
now I comprise... <br>
</p>

<p>
yes, so do I! <br>
but still you laugh <br>
seeing me cry <br>
</p>
