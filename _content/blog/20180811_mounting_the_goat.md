still I try to read you 
from a picture 
shooted so long ago 

were you always like him, 
the one near the sofa? 
and what did I mean? 

or were you like him 
the one by the pestle? 
...actually it's a line we're in 

have I abbandoned you? 
killed you with no mercy? 
I think I've embraced you 
I think I'm mounting the goat 

you suffer from your 
deadly zombie beliefs 
viruses plotted in your brain... 
both of us may never understand 
how could you leave the game? 

come on, hug me tight 
for my hands are cold 
and I need your soul 
to clean my knife 

you once said 
you're through the bridge 
now I comprise... 

yes, so do I! 
but still you laugh 
while seeing me cry
